# AttendanceSystem

This is a python attendance system project.

it utilizes libraries such as opencv, face_recognition, numpy, csv, and datetime

I learned this project and library from this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6464U4bPPQ

I am currently working on improving this project by automating the encoding of all images in the photos folder

This project can also be run on a raspberry pi and with improvement can be used as an intruder alert system.
